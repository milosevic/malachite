    // For round certificates, we process votes one by one, unlike polka and commit certificates,
    // which we process as a whole. The reason for this difference lies in how driver handles equivocated votes.
    //
    // If we were to process polka or commit certificates vote by vote, any equivocated vote (i.e. a vote
    // that conflicts with an already received vote from the same validator) would be discarded. This would
    // cause us to ignore equivocated votes that are part of the certificate and which are important for
    // correct operation of the protocol. To avoid this, we process polka and commit certificates as a whole.
    //
    // For round certificates, however, this is not necessary. It suffices that at least one valid vote
    // (either from the certificate or already present in the system) is processed. Thus, discarding an
    // equivocated vote from the round certificate does not affect correctness.
    //
    // As a result, we decided to simplify the logic for round certificates by handling their votes individually.
    // This avoids extra complexity and edge case handling in the driver.
    //
    // We persist each vote to the WAL the same way a vote received over the network is persisted, rather
    // than the certificate as a whole. On restart the vote keeper re-aggregates the replayed votes and
    // reconstructs the round certificate through the ordinary vote path — no dedicated WAL entry needed.
